- when working on components and functions always think how to design them as generic - pure functions that receive input and operate on it, returning results.
As much as possible, avoid mutating global state.

- functions and components should be compact and short, working on a single concern. 

- for react components, always try to put state as close as possible to the area that needs it, to avoid large sections re-renders

- avoid large files. create separate files per concern/component and import them rather than putting things inline
